    "Python equivalent of the `Drum solo` program. Enjoy Charlie's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program was particularly challenging, since replicating the block `Charlie plays drums`\n",
    "required async execution. Usually, you can do so in Python using threads. \n",
    "However, they have a [couple of drawbacks](https://effectivepython.com/2015/03/10/consider-coroutines-to-run-many-functions-concurrently):\n",
    "\n",
    "* They can be hard to coordinate\n",
    "* They require a lot of memory (~8 MB each)\n",
    "* They have huge overhead (in other words, they can be slow)\n",
    "* Most importantly for us: MicroPython doesn't support it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we need to look for other workarounds. Namely, we will be using coroutines. \n",
    "The solution in this script is built using [this code piece written by David Lechner](https://gist.github.com/dlech/fa48f9b2a3a661c79c2c5880684b63ae).\n",
    "Full credit goes to him. The use of coroutines in this program is explained later on (inside the function `play_drums`).\n",
